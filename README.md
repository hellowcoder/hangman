# Hangman Game (Python)

A simple command-line implementation of the **Hangman** game, where players guess letters to complete a randomly chosen word from a predefined list. The game also includes an optional **hint** feature, where players can reveal a missing letter at the cost of one incorrect guess.

## Features:
- **Word Randomization**: Randomly selects a word from a list of computer science-related terms.
- **Hint System**: Allows players to get a hint (the first missing letter) at the cost of one incorrect guess.
- **Hangman Visuals**: As players make incorrect guesses, a hangman figure is progressively displayed.
- **Replay Option**: After a game ends, players can choose to play again.
- **Input Validation**: Ensures that players enter valid guesses (single alphabetic characters).

## Game Rules:
1. The player is given a word with some letters hidden as underscores (`_`).
2. The player guesses one letter at a time.
3. If the guessed letter is in the word, it is revealed. If not, the number of incorrect guesses increases.
4. The player can choose to receive a hint, which costs one incorrect guess and reveals the first missing letter in the word.
5. The game ends when the player either guesses all the letters correctly or runs out of guesses.
6. A hangman figure is displayed as the player makes incorrect guesses.

## How to Play:
1. **Run the Game**: Execute the script, and you will be prompted to play the game.
2. **Guess Letters**: You will be asked to guess one letter at a time.
3. **Request a Hint**: You can choose to get a hint by typing 'y' when prompted. Each hint reduces one available guess.
4. **Game Progress**: The game will show a current progress of the word (with blanks for unguessed letters) and update the hangman figure for each incorrect guess.
5. **End of Game**: The game ends when either:
   - You guess the word correctly.
   - You run out of incorrect guesses.
